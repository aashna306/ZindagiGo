##  Tech Stack
- Frontend: Flutter (Dart)
- Backend: Node.js (Express)
- Database: MongoDB (User data, medical records)
- Authentication: Firebase Auth
- Storage: MongoDB (for images and user data)
- AI Integration: Google Gemini API (for prescription assistance)

---

##  Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
- Install [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) on your system.
- Set up a Firebase Project and enable Authentication.
- Set up MongoDB Atlas or a local MongoDB database.
- Install Node.js and run the backend server.

### Clone the Repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/arpita-goel/Gsc_Project1.git
cd Gsc_Project1


### Install Dependencies
bash
flutter pub get


### Configure Firebase
1. Download the google-services.json file from Firebase and place it in android/app/.
2. Enable Firestore Database and Storage in Firebase Console.

### Set Up Environment Variables
- Create a .env file in the root directory.
- Copy the contents of .env.example and fill in your API keys.
- Example:
  env
  MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-uri
  GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
  PORT=your-backend-port
  

### Run the App
bash
flutter run


---

##  Backend Setup
### Prerequisites
- Ensure you have Node.js installed.
- Navigate to the backend directory:
  bash
  cd backend/src
  
- Install dependencies:
  bash
  npm install
  
- Start the backend server:
  bash
  npm start
  
- Ensure the backend is running before launching the Flutter app.

üî¥ Emergency Number (SOS Feature) and Fall Detection
To safely test the SOS feature and fall detection without any error , change the emergency number in the codebase:
navigate to :
lib/home_page.dart
change the line at 39 and at 160  with your emergency number, you can also change country code....
=> String emergencyNumber = "+91";


While in an ideal production setup, the emergency number should be stored and fetched securely from the backend for flexibility and ease of updates, we have intentionally avoided this approach during the testing phase, for the following reason......
Controlled Testing Environment
By hardcoding the emergency number in the app, we ensure that only trusted developers or testers can modify it deliberately in the code.
This creates a controlled environment, where testing of the SOS and fall detection features happens safely without triggering unintended or fake emergency calls.
Since our codebase and builds are currently shared with testers and contributors, hardcoding sensitive functionalities like the emergency number helps prevent backend exploitation.

----

üîêOTP Verification (login)
For the purpose of testing and demonstration, we have configured Firebase Authentication to use a test phone number and OTP
Test Phone Number: +91 1234567890
Test OTP: 111111

Reason for This Approach:
Firebase Free Tier Limitations
Firebase does not offer unlimited free SMS verifications. During development and testing, using real phone numbers could quickly exhaust the free quota.
Test numbers allow us to bypass actual SMS sending, ensuring cost-free and unlimited testing.

Avoiding Spam and Abuse
If we used real-time OTPs with dynamic phone numbers, there‚Äôs a risk of misuse or accidental spam to genuine phone numbers.
Test numbers eliminate this risk by providing a controlled environment.

Safe and Reliable Testing
Using test credentials ensures that all testers and developers can log in without needing real phone numbers.
This provides a consistent testing experience across devices and environments.


-----

Medical Records Upload & Category Detection
Our app allows users to upload their medical records (prescriptions, reports, etc.) and automatically detects the category of the record using AI-based OCR and categorization logic.
For Testers:
You can upload any sample image of a medical prescription or report.
The app will process the image using OCR and display the extracted text.
Based on the text, the app will attempt to categorize the record.

##  Deployment
For MVP submission, you can:
- Generate APK:
  bash
  flutter build apk --release
  
- Upload APK to Google Drive and share a public link: [üîó Download APK](YOUR_GOOGLE_DRIVE_LINK_HERE)

##  Additional Setup for Testing
- Battery Optimization
To ensure background services run properly, please disable battery optimization for this app
1. Go to Settings > Battery & Performance
2. Select Battery Optimization
3. Find "Zindagi Go" and set it to "Don't optimize"

(Steps may vary by device. Check your phone‚Äôs settings for more details.)

- Chat, User Info and medical records Configuration:
  - Ensure that your IPv4 address is correctly set for backend communication when testing chat and user details.
  - If testing on an emulator, provide the emulator‚Äôs assigned **IPv4 address.
  - Recommended: Test on a real device connected to the same WiFi network as the backend server for full feature access.
  
- Emergency Contact Setup:
  - Open HomePage in the code and manually set an emergency contact number to test fall detection and SOS feature.

## ‚ö† Troubleshooting
### Common Issues & Fixes
1. Firebase Authentication Error  
   - Ensure Firebase Auth is enabled and google-services.json is correctly placed in android/app/.
2. Backend Connection Issues  
   - Verify that MongoDB is running and that your backend is connected.
   - Double-check the IPv4 address configuration in the UserInfoPage medical records page and ChatPage.
3. Notifications Not Working  
   - Enable notifications in Firebase and check that the app has notification permissions.
4. Location Sharing Not Working  
   - Ensure location permissions are granted on the device.

##  Permissions Required
- Camera & Storage - Required for OCR-based prescription scanning.
- Microphone - Needed for voice-activated SOS feature.
- Location - Required for live location sharing with emergency contacts.

---

##  How to Customize Zindagi Go
- Change Emergency Contact:
  - Open HomePage.dart and update the emergencyContact variable.
- Modify Backend URL:
  - Update the .env file with the correct PORT and MONGO_URI.
- IPv4 Configuration:
  - Ensure phone and laptop are connected to the same WiFi.
  - Update IPv4 settings in UserInfoPage.dart and ChatPage.dart.
